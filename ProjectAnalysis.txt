Game: Doodle Jump (Best supported by the library)
Game Idea 2: Bounce Tales. (It is really difficult platformer game but includes really cool physics...)

Assets origin: https://github.com/justinsoon/buskeyjump

What to do?

MILESTONE-1:
    - Scrape necessary graphics surely I can find some free as the game is popular.
    - Read the documentation and pinpoint the necessary methods needed for the game.
    - Make sure to break down the classes that I want to create on paper before making the project.

MILESTONE-2:
    - Try to implement some of game's mechanics of bounce tales on doodle jump to make the game more interesting.


Success Criteria:
1. Make it so that the character can jump.
2. If it jumps once the ground doesnot hold the character.
3. Random formation of green tiles.
4. Make it so that doodle can jump in the tiles.
5. Make special tile that can move sideways, that produces spikes or any special(Use inheritance to make it special)
6. Make scoreboard. I mean counter of how high the character is in.
7. Optional: Make a score of highest points gotten by someone.
             Do this by making a text file that can store the highest score and update HS if someone breaks the record.
8. Optional: Make sure to add sound effects...
